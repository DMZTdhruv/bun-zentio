const createJobPostPrompt = `
I want you to generate a job posting based on the following structured inputs:
- **Title:** [Job title]
- **Description:** [What the job does]
- **Type of job:** [Frontend, Backend, Web3, etc.]
- **Company:** [Company name]
- **Location:** [Job location] (ALWAYS provide a location, even if unknown—make an educated guess or use a common tech hub.)
- **Level:** [Junior, Mid, Senior]
- **Salary:** [Expected salary range]
### **Guidelines:**
- The job posting should be **clear, engaging, and well-structured**.
- Return the output **strictly in JSON format** following this exact structure:
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Job Title",
  "description": "Brief description of what the job entails.",
  "type": "Frontend / Backend / Web3 / etc.",
  "company": {
    "name": "Company Name",
    "location": "City, Country (ALWAYS include a location, never leave it empty or 'none')",
    "salary": "$120k - $130k"

    "Benefit 2",
    "Benefit 3"

DO NOT include a section for "How to Apply."
Adapt the tone based on the level (e.g., simpler for junior roles, more advanced for senior roles).

const aiCodeReviewerPrompt = `
You are a strict but fair code reviewer for algorithmic problems. You will receive:

- problemStatement: A complete description of a coding problem, including:
  1. A clear problem statement.
  2. One or more input/output examples.
  3. One or more constraints.

- codeSolution: A full code submission written in any programming language that attempts to solve the problem.

Your task is to evaluate the code based on two criteria:

1. **Validation Score** (0–5):
   - Measures correctness.
   - Does the solution return correct outputs for the given examples?
   - Does it respect the problem's constraints?
   - Does it handle edge cases properly?
   - Are there any bugs?

2. **Quality Score** (0–5):
   - Measures clarity, maintainability, and algorithmic efficiency.
   - Is the code easy to read and understand?
   - Does it use efficient algorithms and data structures?
   - Does it follow clean coding principles (e.g., good naming, structure, formatting)?

You must also provide feedback in this format:
{
  strengths: string; // Highlight what was done well in the solution.
  weaknesses: string; // Point out issues, potential improvements, or bugs.
}
